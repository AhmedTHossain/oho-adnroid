    <string name="what_is_oho">Oho! is a modern dating app that connects two most popular concepts - Food and Dating. We partner with local cafes and restaurants to bring an amazing dining experience while you get to know your potential partner in a safe environment.</string>
    <string name="how_does_it_work">Oho! is different than other dating apps. It works as following â€“
        \n\nA week is divided into 2 phases â€“ Matching and Dating
        \n\nMatching phase lasts from Sunday 6:00 PM till Thursday 12:00 AM
        \n\nDating phase lasts on Thursday evening till Sunday afternoon for selected times
        \n\nWhen you open the app during â€˜matching phaseâ€™ we ask you for your availability during â€˜dating phaseâ€™. As a part of the Oho! community, you are expected you to honor your commitment
        \n\nWe match you using the default location that you put in the app
        \n\nDuring â€˜matching phaseâ€™, we use our machine learning algorithms to show you a handful of potential matches every day. Once you match with 2 people, we stop showing you more matches. We do not want you to feel overwhelmed ðŸ™‚
        \n\nDetails of your date can be found in the chat, but you cannot send any messages. â€˜Chat featureâ€™ is unlocked only after you go on your date.
        \n\nWe set up a date for you and your match at a restaurant based on your location, availability, and cuisine preferences.
        \n\nYou show up early to your date and the host will guide you to your table. Get to know your match over good food and good conversation</string>

    <string name="if_i_dont_show_up">You get penalized for not showing up. We expect you to live up to your commitment and respect your matchesâ€™ time. The penalties are as follows â€“
         \n\nIf you fail to show up for the first time, your account will be suspended for 2 weeks.
         \n\nIf you fail to show up for the 2nd time, your account will be suspended for 4 weeks.
         \n\nIf you fail to show up for the 3rd time, your account will be suspended for 8 weeks.
         \n\nAfter 8 weeks your account will reset back. We believe that people can change for the better ðŸ™‚ (In the future, there will be a rescheduling option)</string>

    <string name="is_oho_safe">Unlike other customers in a restaurant, the manager and the staff are aware that you are meeting your match for the first time. So, if the situation gets uncomfortable, you can reach out to the staff. They are there to ensure your safety!
        \n\nWe use real time face recognition to cross check if the person creating the profile is really the person himself/herself. This eliminates bots and fake profiles in our community
        \n\nThere is also a feature where you can share/update your location with a close friend or family member.
        \n\nWe also have safe dating tips/guidelines to ensure best dating experience on our platform.
        \n\nAnyone who gets reported 3 times for bad behavior or harassment and such will be banned permanently from our community.</string>

    <string name="motivation">Small talk leads to nowhere

        \n\nTexts leave room for too many interpretations
        \n\nGhosting is the norm when your match loses interest or finds someone better
        \n\nSomeone can easily fake being your match to send messages
        \n\nTo build a community of people who prefers in real life and meaningful connection.
        \n\nOur growing community of people are serious and respects each others time
        \n\nWe believe that communication is key in building a successful relationship, and body language plays an essential role in effective communication. So, we want you to ditch the small talk over chat and meet your match in real life
        \n\nFood!!! Who does not love food??
        \n\nWe are promoting local business for free!! Our goal is to increase customer traffic with our partner restaurants and cafÃ©s.</string>
